# ðŸš€ Advanced Controller Design: Gain-Scheduled LQR for a Self-Landing Rocket

This project implements an advanced control strategy for a self-landing rocket using a **Gain-Scheduled Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** combined with a **Disturbance Observer (DOB)**. The controller accounts for time-varying mass and dynamic uncertainties such as wind disturbances and low-bandwidth actuator dynamics.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2022b or newer
- Control System Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

### Run Simulation

```matlab
cd matlab_code
main_simulation
```

### Output

  - Tracking performance
  - Disturbance estimation
  - Rocket position and velocity profiles
  - Comparison across disturbance scenarios

## ðŸ“Š Results

Simulation results indicate that the gain-scheduled LQR + DOB controller significantly improves trajectory tracking and robustness under time-varying disturbances, particularly in challenging wind conditions.
