# ðŸš€ Advanced Controller Design: Gain-Scheduled LQR for a Self-Landing Rocket

This project implements a control strategy for a self-landing rocket using a **Gain-Scheduled Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** and a **Disturbance Observer (DOB)**. The system is tested under challenging conditions such as mass variation and wind disturbances.

## âœ¨ Features

- Gain-Scheduled LQR for handling time-varying rocket mass
- Disturbance Observer for external force estimation
- TVC actuator modeled with low-pass dynamics
- MATLAB-based simulation

## ðŸ“‚ How to Run

1. Run `gaintable_6DOF_sim.m` to generate the gain schedule table.
2. Run `observer_gaintable_6DOF.m` to generate the observer gain schedule.
3. Run `Observer_full_simulation.m` to simulate the full rocket landing scenario.

All files are located in the `matlab_code` folder.

## ðŸ“„ Report

The final project report is available in IEEE format under the `report/` folder.
